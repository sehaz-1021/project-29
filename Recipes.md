Take the dough out and roll it into a circle.
Puff out the edge of the dough so the crust is thicker at the edge.
Pre-heat oven to 250-260 degrees C. (Remember to put a pizza stone in the oven).
Put on the pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings.
Put the pizza on the pizza stone in the oven.
Bake for 30 minutes or until pizza is crispy and golden brown. (make sure you don't burn the toppings).
Try putting the toppings on the pizza differently to make the pizza look cool! (you can also change the shape of your pizza such as square or triangle).
Enjoy your homemade pizza!!!
